   FINAL FANTASY IV - ULTIMA PLUS
        Canon Remaster Style
     by FF4 Ultima Contributors




A. OVERVIEW
   ========

   A compilation of graphics style patch and Modern Names (Firaga, etc)
   for FF4 Ultima Plus. Aiming to be as canon as possible
   (based on multiple sources), while trying to be consistent between the
   graphical aspects and optimizing all upgrade patches available,
   within the current SNES limitation of FF4 Ultima Plus.




B. NOTES
   =====


1. This patch is NOT COMPATIBLE WITH ANY GRAPHICS AND FONTS IPS PATCHES.
   Patch this to a clean FF4 Ultima Plus Rom.
   Other patches like alternate mechanics are okay.

2. Recommended to be played with MSU-1 Pixel Remaster Music for full
   remaster experience, or the Synthetic Origins if you prefer an
   upgraded original music. You can also mix tracks.
   Patch the msu-1 after implementing this Canon Remaster patch.
   Guides on FF4 Ultima MSU-1 is also available in this folder.

3. Biggest dilemma is to choose between dark purple or dark gray DK Cecil.
   We chose dark gray Oni faced DK Cecil, because PSP FMVs can be interpreted
   as the real live depiction of the characters, while still not far from Amano.
   Amano's dark purple DK Cecil are also surrealistic, which can be interpreted
   as an alternate, dreamy, psychedelic form, of DK Cecil.
   This dark gray decision also makes DK Cecil having distinct colors with 
   dark purple Kain and black Golbez.

4. If you only want to use a certain aspect of the Canon Remaster Style to make
   another personal preference mix, or you want to exclude some stuffs like
   excluding the modern names, there are separate individual patches
   in this folder. Follow the patching orders if using more than one patches.
   Share your mix at FF4 Ultima Discord "Optional Patches/Mixes" subsection.
