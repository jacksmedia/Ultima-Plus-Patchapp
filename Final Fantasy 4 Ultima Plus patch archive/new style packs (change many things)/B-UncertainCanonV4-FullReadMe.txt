FF4 Ultima Style - Uncertain Canon v4


Graphics style for FF4 Ultima,
aimed to be as close as possible to the
non-chibi 3D models appearances of FF4
characters.
(Dissidia, FF14, non-chibi FMVs,
other medias, etc)
In some ways, these can be considered
the way that the characters should look
like.

This will be the FINAL version for a long
time and it's still not perfect because
of the many limitations in the game.
(Color palettes limitations, tedious Golbez
porting, etc)
But these are already very good in my
opinion for many reasons.

The spriters are trying their best.
Thank you for all their amazing works.
Also please check out their other
alternate sprites.

Overview, detailed patch used, credits,
and changes, are attached below.

=====================

Overview


1. PSP Style menu portraits, PR Style map
sprites, and RK Style battle sprites.

2. No additional Font style. No additional
Monster Graphics style. No optional fixes
patched.
(So that you can choose your prefered
ones for those)

3. Some necessary changes are edited
only from their first ports of their sprite
category. Any possible bad results from
that are not the credited spriter's fault.

4. Errors known : Some bad pixels
because of a clash between Golbez RK
Battle Sprite and his PR map sprite.
A very small trade for the sake of sprite
consistency.
