FF4 Ultima Style - Canon


Graphics style for FF4 Ultima,
aimed to be as close as possible to the
non-chibi 3D models appearances of FF4
characters. (Dissidia, FF14, non-chibi FMVs,
other medias, etc)
In some ways, these can be considered
the way that the characters should look
like.

The spriters are trying their best.
Thank you for all their amazing works.
Also please check out their other
alternate sprites.

Overview, detailed patch used, credits,
and changes, are attached below.

=====================

Overview


1. PSP Style menu portraits, PR Style map
sprites, and RK Style battle sprites.

2. Uses SNES monster graphic update patch.
No additional Font style and no optional
fixes patched.
(So that you can choose your prefered
ones for those)

3. Some necessary changes are edited
only from their first ports of their sprite
category. Any possible bad results from
that are not the credited spriter's fault.
