These patches will let you play the game with alternate fonts, and with absolute minimal use of "squished" multi-letters if desired (SquishBGone fonts).

Dozens of new character options are available for map sprites, battle sprites, and menu portrait art.

Special enhanced monster graphics patches exist, too!
Please refer to each addendum's readme and PNG files for preview.

The IPS patches only work with a patched, no-header version of FF4 Ultima.
Not all of them are compatible together.

FFIV MSU-1 patch (not included) is known to cause visual bugs with the 4bpp Monster graphics patches.
