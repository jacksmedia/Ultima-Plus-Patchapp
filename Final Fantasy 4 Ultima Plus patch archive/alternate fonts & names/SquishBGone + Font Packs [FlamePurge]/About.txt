CHANGES: Menu text related to items and spells, as well as pieces of dialogue that reference those items and spells.

EFFECT: Removes usage of most squish tiles (2-3+ letters shrunk together into 1-2+ letter's width, to circumvent letter limitations) through various means for a clean, appealing aesthetic. At times, this involved renaming items and spells; please see the "Name Differences" section in the Changelog for information.
